## üìã Deployment Checklist

Before you deploy, make sure you have:

### Required Setup
- [ ] Vercel account created (free tier is fine)

Go to: **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**

#### Minimal (Required to run):
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` - Your app name
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your deployment URL

#### EmailJS (For contact form):
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`

## üéØ What Happens After Deployment?

Once you deploy, Vercel will:

### Automatic Deployments
Every time you push to GitHub:
- **Push to main** ‚Üí Deploys to Production
- **Push to staging** ‚Üí Deploys to Staging Preview
- **Push to development** ‚Üí Deploys to Development Preview

### URLs You'll Get
- **Production**: `next-web-site-template.vercel.app`
- **Staging**: `staging-next-web-site-template-xxx.vercel.app`
- **Development**: `development-next-web-site-template-xxx.vercel.app`

### Build & Deploy
1. Vercel detects the push
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Runs `npm run build`
4. Deploys to appropriate environment
5. Sends you a notification (if enabled)

---

## üîß Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Set Environment Variables (IMPORTANT!)

For each environment, you need to set variables:

**Production (main branch):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://next-web-site-template.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=prod_service_id
# ... etc
```

**Staging (staging branch):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://staging-next-web-site-template.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=staging_service_id
# ... etc
```

**Development (development branch):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://development-next-web-site-template.vercel.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=dev_service_id
# ... etc
```

üìö **See `.env.vercel` file for the complete list of variables**

### 2. Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

**For Production:**
1. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Domains**
2. Click "Add Domain"
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `mywebsite.com`)
4. Follow DNS configuration instructions
5. Wait for SSL certificate (automatic)

**For Staging:**
1. Add subdomain: `staging.mywebsite.com`
2. Configure to deploy from `staging` branch

### 3. Enable Branch Protection on GitHub

To prevent direct pushes and require reviews:

**Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí Add rule**

For `main`:
- Require pull request reviews (2 approvals)
- Require status checks to pass
- Vercel deployment checks

For `staging`:
- Require pull request reviews (1 approval)
- Require status checks to pass

For `development`:
- Require status checks to pass

## üìä Monitoring Your Deployments

### Via Vercel Dashboard
- **Deployments Tab**: See all deployments and their status
- **Logs**: Click on a deployment to see build logs
- **Analytics**: Track performance (Pro plan required)
- **Real-time Logs**: Monitor runtime errors

### Via CLI
```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# View logs for a deployment
vercel logs <deployment-url>

# Check project info
vercel inspect <deployment-url>
```

---

## üß™ Test Your Deployment

### 1. Trigger a Test Deployment

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Create a test file
echo "# Deployment Test" > TEST_DEPLOYMENT.md

# Commit and push
git add TEST_DEPLOYMENT.md
git commit -m "test: verify deployment pipeline"
git push origin development
```

### 2. Watch the Deployment

1. Go to https://vercel.com/saga95/next-web-site-template
2. You'll see a new deployment for `development` branch
3. Click on it to see build logs in real-time
4. Wait for "Building" ‚Üí "Deploying" ‚Üí "Ready"
5. Click "Visit" to see your deployed site

### 3. Verify Deployment

- [ ] Site loads successfully
- [ ] All pages work
- [ ] i18n works (language switcher)
- [ ] Theme switching works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Fails

**Symptoms**: Red X on deployment, build errors

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Test build locally first
npm run build

# Check for TypeScript errors
npm run type-check

# Check for lint errors
npm run lint:check
```

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms**: `undefined` values in production

**Solutions**:
1. Check variable names (case-sensitive)
2. Make sure you've set them on Vercel dashboard
3. Redeploy after adding variables
4. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables

### Issue: Deployment Not Triggering

**Symptoms**: Push to GitHub but no deployment

**Solutions**:
1. Check GitHub integration is connected
2. Verify branch deployments are enabled
3. Check for build errors in previous deployment
4. Reconnect GitHub integration
