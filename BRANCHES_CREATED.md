## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up Branch Protection Rules on GitHub

Go to: **Settings → Branches → Add branch protection rule**

#### For `main` branch:
```
Branch name pattern: main

✅ Require a pull request before merging
   ✅ Require approvals: 2
   ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
   
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Status checks: lint, test, build
   
✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches
   - Only allow: release/* and hotfix/* branches
```

#### For `staging` branch:
```
Branch name pattern: staging

✅ Require a pull request before merging
   ✅ Require approvals: 1
   
✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   Status checks: lint, test, build
   
✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches
   - Allow: development, release/* branches
```

#### For `development` branch:
```
Branch name pattern: development

✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   Status checks: lint, test

✅ Allow force pushes: No
```

### 2. Configure Deployment Platform

Choose your deployment platform and configure environments:

#### **Option A: Vercel**
1. Go to: **Project Settings → Git → Production Branch**
   - Set to: `main`

2. Go to: **Project Settings → Git → Preview Branches**
   - Enable: `staging`, `development`

3. Go to: **Project Settings → Environment Variables**
   - Add variables for each environment:
     - Production (main)
     - Preview (staging, development)

#### **Option B: Netlify**
1. Go to: **Site Settings → Build & deploy → Deploy contexts**
   - Production branch: `main`
   - Branch deploys: `staging`, `development`

2. Go to: **Site Settings → Build & deploy → Environment**
   - Add variables for Production, Deploy Previews, and Branch deploys

#### **Option C: AWS Amplify**
1. Create separate apps for each environment OR
2. Use branch-based deployment with environment variables per branch

### 3. Set Up Local Environment

On your machine:
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env.local

# Edit with your local values
nano .env.local

# Or use the setup script
./scripts/setup-env.sh
```

### 4. Start Development Workflow

#### Create a new feature:
```bash
# Switch to development
git checkout development
git pull origin development

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-awesome-feature

# Develop your feature
npm run dev

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my awesome feature"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feature/my-awesome-feature
```

Then create a Pull Request on GitHub to merge into `development`.

### 5. Test the CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow will run automatically on:
- Push to `main`, `staging`, or `development`
- Pull requests to these branches

To test it, create a small change and push:
```bash
git checkout development
echo "# Test" >> TEST.md
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin development
```

Check the **Actions** tab on GitHub to see the pipeline running.

### 6. Configure Secrets for CI/CD (Optional)

If you want to use the full CI/CD pipeline with deployments, add these secrets:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

- `VERCEL_TOKEN` - For Vercel deployments
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - For Netlify deployments
- `SNYK_TOKEN` - For security scanning
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK` - For notifications
- Any other API keys or tokens needed
