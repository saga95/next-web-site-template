## ✅ What Was Updated

Based on the Figma screenshot showing the Share dialog, we've emphasized throughout the documentation that users **MUST** use "Copy Dev Mode link" (not "Copy prototype link") for Figma MCP to work correctly.

## 📝 Files Updated

### 1. **MCP_SETUP_GUIDE.md** (Enhanced)

#### Added Critical Warning in Quick Setup:

```markdown
2. **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Always Use "Copy Dev Mode Link"**:
   - In Figma, click the **Share** button (top right)
   - Click **"Copy Dev Mode link"** (NOT "Copy prototype link")
   - This ensures you get the correct file key and node ID format
   - The Dev Mode link includes design metadata needed by MCP
```

#### Enhanced Figma Integration Section:

```markdown
### 🚨 CRITICAL: Always Use "Copy Dev Mode Link"

When sharing Figma designs with MCP:

1. **Select your node/component** in Figma
2. **Click Share button** (top right)
3. **Click "Copy Dev Mode link"** ✅ (NOT "Copy prototype link")
4. **Paste the link** in your Copilot Chat prompt

**Why Dev Mode Link?**
- ✅ Includes design specifications (colors, spacing, typography)
- ✅ Correct file key and node ID format
- ✅ Access to component metadata
- ❌ Prototype links don't work with MCP

**Visual Reference**: See the "Copy Dev Mode link" option in 
Figma's Share dialog (shown in your screenshot).

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Problem (From Your Screenshot)

In Figma's Share dialog, there are multiple link options:
- "Copy prototype link" ❌
- "Copy Dev Mode link" ✅
- "Get embed code"
- "Publish to Community"

Users might accidentally click the wrong option.

### Solution

The documentation now **prominently warns** users at every relevant section:

1. ✅ **Quick Setup section** - First thing users see
2. ✅ **Figma Integration section** - Dedicated warning block
3. ✅ **Quick Reference Card** - At the top
4. ✅ **README** - In Getting Started and Development Workflow

### Why Dev Mode Link is Required

| Feature | Dev Mode Link | Prototype Link |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Design Specifications | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Component Metadata | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Color/Typography Data | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Spacing/Layout Info | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Node ID Format | ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
| MCP Compatibility | ✅ Works | ❌ Fails |
