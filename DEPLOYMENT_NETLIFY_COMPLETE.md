---

## üå≥ Ready for All Branches

The Netlify configuration works with all your branches:

```
‚úÖ main (Production)       ‚Üí netlify.toml configured
‚úÖ staging (Branch Deploy)  ‚Üí netlify.toml configured
‚úÖ development (Branch Deploy) ‚Üí netlify.toml configured
```

All branches will use the same `netlify.toml` file, with context-specific settings applied automatically!

---

## üöÄ Three Ways to Deploy on Netlify

### **Option 1: Interactive Script (Easiest)**
```bash
./scripts/deploy-netlify.sh
```
Then select option 1 for dashboard deployment.

### **Option 2: Manual Dashboard (Recommended for First Time)**
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/start
2. Click "Import from Git"
3. Select "GitHub"
4. Choose **saga95/web-site-template**
5. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
6. Click "Deploy site"

### **Option 3: CLI (For Developers)**
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Initialize and deploy
netlify init
# or
netlify deploy --build
```

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` - Your app name
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your deployment URL (or use `DEPLOY_PRIME_URL`)

#### EmailJS (For contact form):
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` (per context)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` (per context)
- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` (per context)

üìù **Note**: Set different values for each context (Production, Branch deploys, Deploy previews)

## üéØ What Happens After Deployment?

Once you deploy to Netlify:

### Automatic Deployments
Every time you push to GitHub:
- **Push to main** ‚Üí Production deploy
- **Push to staging** ‚Üí Staging branch deploy
- **Push to development** ‚Üí Development branch deploy
- **Pull Request** ‚Üí Deploy preview

### URLs You'll Get
- **Production**: `web-site-template.netlify.app`
- **Staging**: `staging--web-site-template.netlify.app`
- **Development**: `development--web-site-template.netlify.app`
- **PR Preview**: `deploy-preview-{PR#}--web-site-template.netlify.app`

### Build & Deploy Process
1. Netlify detects the push
2. Runs `npm install`
3. Runs `npm run build`
4. Applies Next.js plugin optimizations
5. Deploys to appropriate context
6. Sends you a notification

---

## üîß Netlify-Specific Features

### 1. Deploy Contexts (Better than Vercel's branch deployments)

Netlify has three contexts with different settings:

**Production** (main branch):
```toml
[context.production]
  command = "npm run build"
  [context.production.environment]
    NODE_ENV = "production"
```

**Branch Deploys** (staging, development):
```toml
[context.staging]
  command = "npm run build"
  [context.staging.environment]
    NODE_ENV = "production"
```

**Deploy Previews** (Pull Requests):
```toml
[context.deploy-preview]
  command = "npm run build"
```

### 2. Environment Variables by Context

Each variable can have different values for each context:

```
Variable: NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID
‚îú‚îÄ Production: prod_service_id
‚îú‚îÄ Branch deploys: staging_service_id
‚îî‚îÄ Deploy previews: dev_service_id
```

### 3. Netlify Functions (Serverless)

Create API endpoints without a server:

```javascript
// netlify/functions/api.js
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: JSON.stringify({ message: "Hello from Netlify!" })
  };
};
```

Access at: `/.netlify/functions/api`

### 4. Edge Functions (Faster than Functions)

Run code at the edge (closer to users):

```javascript
// netlify/edge-functions/hello.js
export default async () => {
  return new Response("Hello from the edge!");
};
```

### 5. Split Testing (A/B Testing)

Test two versions of your site:
- Deploy branch: `experiment/new-feature`
- Split traffic: 50/50 between main and experiment
- Monitor analytics

## üß™ Test Your Netlify Deployment

### 1. Trigger a Test Deployment

```bash
# Switch to development branch
git checkout development

# Create a test file
echo "# Netlify Deployment Test" > NETLIFY_TEST.md

# Commit and push
git add NETLIFY_TEST.md
git commit -m "test: verify Netlify deployment pipeline"
git push origin development
```

### 2. Watch the Deployment

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/web-site-template/deploys
2. You'll see a new deployment for `development` branch
3. Click on it to see build logs in real-time
4. Wait for "Building" ‚Üí "Deploying" ‚Üí "Published"
5. Click "Preview deploy" to see your deployed site

### 3. Verify Deployment

- [ ] Site loads successfully
- [ ] All pages work
- [ ] i18n works (language switcher)
- [ ] Theme switching works
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Environment variables are set correctly
- [ ] Branch deploy URL is correct

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Build Fails with Next.js Error

**Symptoms**: Error about Next.js runtime or build failure

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Make sure Next.js plugin is installed
npm install -D @netlify/plugin-nextjs

# Verify netlify.toml has the plugin
[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

### Issue: Environment Variables Not Working

**Symptoms**: `undefined` values in deployed site

**Solutions**:
1. Check you've set variables in Netlify dashboard
2. Select correct context (Production/Branch/Preview)
3. Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side variables
4. Redeploy after adding variables
5. Clear build cache: `netlify build --clear-cache`

### Issue: Static Files Not Found (404)

**Symptoms**: Images or static files return 404

**Solutions**:
1. Verify publish directory is `.next` (not `out`)
2. Check files are in `public/` directory
3. Use correct paths (e.g., `/images/logo.png` not `./images/logo.png`)

## ‚úÖ What's Next?

Now that Netlify deployment is configured:

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. ‚úÖ **Deploy to Netlify** using one of the methods above
2. ‚¨ú **Install Next.js plugin** on Netlify dashboard
3. ‚¨ú **Set environment variables** for all contexts
4. ‚¨ú **Test all three contexts** (production, staging, development)
5. ‚¨ú **Configure EmailJS** credentials per context
6. ‚¨ú **Set up custom domain** (optional)

### Future Steps:
- [ ] Enable Netlify Analytics
- [ ] Set up Netlify Forms for contact form (alternative to EmailJS)
- [ ] Configure Netlify Identity for authentication
- [ ] Add split testing for A/B tests
- [ ] Set up edge functions for performance
- [ ] Configure deploy notifications (Slack, email, etc.)

---

## üéâ You Now Have TWO Deployment Options!

You can deploy to either platform:

### **Vercel** (Recommended for Next.js)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-vercel.sh
```

### **Netlify** (Recommended for features)
```bash
./scripts/deploy-netlify.sh
```

Or deploy to **BOTH** and use DNS routing! üöÄ
